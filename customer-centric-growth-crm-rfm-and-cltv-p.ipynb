For example, an online retailer tracks the steps a customer goes through, starting from visiting a website, selecting a product, and making a purchase. It also includes post-sale services and gathering customer feedback. This process is visualized with visual techniques and tracked using various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).\n\n    2. **Communication**: The communication with customers should have a language and strategy. This includes the brand's language, colors, visuals, and campaigns. It's a part of corporate marketing concepts. For instance, if a company wants to emphasize \"eco-friendly products,\" the communication strategy may involve using nature-inspired colors and focusing on the concept of sustainability in advertisements.\n\n    3. **Customer Acquisition Efforts**: Companies engage in efforts to acquire new customers. However, as per marketing rules, efforts to retain existing customers are more important than acquiring new ones. For example, an online retailer might attempt to retain loyal customers by offering them special discounts.\n\n    4. **Cross-Selling**: This strategy aims to suggest complementary or supplementary products to a customer when they purchase a product. For example, if a customer buys a laptop, you can suggest additional products like a portable hard drive or a printer.\n\n    5. **Up-Selling**: This strategy involves attempting to sell a higher quality or larger-sized product to a customer who has already made a purchase. For example, if a customer has purchased a basic laptop, you can recommend a premium laptop with better features.\n\n    6. **Customer Segmentation Efforts**: Customer segmentation involves dividing customers into specific groups. For instance, a hotel can treat customers traveling for business in a separate segment and offer them special benefits tailored to business trips.\n\n    7. **CRM Analytics**: CRM analytics aims to make the entire customer relationship process more data-driven. This involves data analysis and the development of strategies for better customer relationship management. For example, an e-commerce company can analyze customer data to determine the most preferred products and adjust marketing strategies to highlight these products.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id = \"3\"></a><br>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Rockwell', cursive; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 2px; color: #556B2F; font-size: 180%; text-align: left; padding: 0px; border-bottom: 3px solid\">✨KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)✨</p>\n\n**What is KPI?**\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs) are mathematical metrics used to assess the performance of a company, department, or employees. KPIs can be reported on a monthly basis, and when combined with visualizations and analyses, they can be tracked more effectively. KPIs are important tools for measuring an organization's success and improving business strategies.\n\n**KPI Examples:**\n\n1. **Customer Acquisition Rate:** This KPI represents the percentage of customers acquired by a company within a specific time frame through activities such as advertising campaigns and marketing efforts. It helps gauge the effectiveness of customer acquisition efforts.\n\n   *Example:* A company running a marketing campaign to acquire new customers measures the success of the campaign by monitoring how many new customers it gained during a particular month.\n\n2. **Customer Retention Rate:** This metric tracks how long users continue to use a product or service, such as a mobile app. It indicates the rate at which users maintain their engagement with the product over time.\n\n   *Example:* A mobile app developer monitors the percentage of users who continue to use their app after the first month, second month, and so on, to assess user loyalty.\n\n3. **Customer Churn Rate:** Customer churn rate indicates the rate at which customers leave a company. It involves both new and existing customers and quantifies the customer attrition process.\n\n   *Example:* A subscription-based service tracks how many subscribers cancel their memberships in a given month. This information is vital for understanding customer retention.\n\n4. **Conversion Rate:** The conversion rate measures the success of a specific action, like clicking on an advertisement or taking a desired action on a website after viewing a page or an ad. It is typically expressed as a percentage.\n\n   *Example:* An e-commerce website monitors the number of visitors who make a purchase after clicking on a promotional banner. The conversion rate helps evaluate the banner's effectiveness.\n\n5. **Growth Rate:** The growth rate indicates how well a company is progressing towards its predetermined goals over specific time periods. It is used to monitor long-term objectives and strategic growth.\n\n   *Example:* A start-up aims to double its user base within a year. The growth rate would be calculated by comparing the number of users at the beginning and end of the year.\n\nKPIs provide valuable insights that enable businesses to measure their performance, make informed decisions, and continually improve their strategies and operations.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id = \"4\"></a><br>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Rockwell', cursive; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 2px; color: #556B2F; font-size: 180%; text-align: left; padding: 0px; border-bottom: 3px solid\">✨Analysis of Cohort✨</p>\n\n**What is a Cohort?**  \nA cohort refers to a group of people who share a specific attribute or common characteristic. For example, customers who purchase a product during the same period can form the same cohort. Cohorts are typically defined based on a specific historical or demographic context, bringing together individuals with similar experiences or characteristics.\n\n**What is Cohort Analysis?**  \nCohort analysis signifies a detailed examination of the behavior of a group of people who share a specific attribute. The purpose of this analysis is to study the behaviors of a particular cohort during a specific time period. Businesses or researchers often use cohort analysis to understand how a particular cohort changes over time.\n\n**Example Application: Churn Rate Analysis**  \nFor instance, the \"churn rate\" represents the behavior of a cohort that shares the common attribute of leaving a brand. Cohort analysis involves studying how these churn rates change over time. Specifically, it is used to track whether customers who abandoned a brand during a certain period continue to do so in subsequent periods. This analysis helps businesses understand customer loyalty and determine how long customers retain their loyalty to a brand.\n\nCohort analysis is an important tool to better understand the behaviors of specific groups and how individuals with certain characteristics interact. Such analyses provide valuable insights to businesses and researchers for adjusting business strategies, product development, and increasing customer loyalty.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id = \"5\"></a><br>\n# <p style=\"border-radius: 10px; border: 4px solid #2E1A47; background-color: #F5F5DC; font-family: 'Rockwell', cursive; font-weight: bold; font-size: 150%; text-align: center; border-radius: 15px 50px; padding: 5px; box-shadow: 4px 4px 4px #556B2F; color: #556B2F;\">RFM Analysis</p>\n\n**RFM Analysis Overview**:\n- RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary.\n- RFM Analysis is a technique used for customer segmentation.\n- It involves grouping customers based on their purchasing habits and allows for the development of tailored strategies for each group.\n- RFM provides various data-driven actions for CRM efforts.\n\n**RFM Metrics**:\n1. **Recency (R)**: Indicates how recently a customer made a purchase. For example, if we have two customers with Recency values of 1 and 10, the one with a Recency value of 1 is more valuable as they made a purchase just one day ago (on a daily basis).\n\n2. **Frequency (F)**: Represents the total number of purchases/transactions a customer has made.\n\n3. **Monetary (M)**: Reflects the monetary value that customers have contributed to the business.\n\n**RFM Scoring**:\n- To standardize the RFM metrics, they are transformed into scores ranging from 1 to 5, from the smallest (least recent, least frequent, or least monetary) to the largest. However, for Recency, the score is assigned inversely; the smallest Recency gets the highest score.\n\n- An RFM score is represented by writing the R, F, and M scores together. For example, if a customer has an R score of 5, F score of 4, and M score of 2, their RFM score would be written as - 542.\n\n- When segmenting customers, it is often more important for the customer to interact with the site and make a purchase rather than their monetary value. The frequency and recency of their interactions are often of greater significance. Hence, segmenting based on two dimensions (R-F) can be a valuable approach.\n\n- Once customer segmentation is complete, departments can begin their campaign operations tailored to these segments.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"----","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id = \"6\"></a><br>\n# <p style=\"border-radius: 10px; border: 4px solid #2E1A47; background-color: #F5F5DC; font-family: 'Rockwell', cursive; font-weight: bold; font-size: 150%; text-align: center; border-radius: 15px 50px; padding: 5px; box-shadow: 4px 4px 4px #556B2F; color: #556B2F;\">Customer Segmentation with RFM</p>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id = \"7\"></a><br>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Rockwell', cursive; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 2px; color: #556B2F; font-size: 180%; text-align: left; padding: 0px; border-bottom: 3px solid\">✨Business Problem✨</p>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"An e-commerce company aims to segment its customers and formulate marketing strategies based on these segments.\n\nThe dataset \"Online Retail II\" contains the sales of an online retail store based in the United Kingdom from 01/12/2009 to 09/12/2011.\n\nSource: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail+II","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id = \"8\"></a><br>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Rockwell', cursive; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 2px; color: #556B2F; font-size: 180%; text-align: left; padding: 0px; border-bottom: 3px solid\">✨Data Understanding✨</p>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport datetime as dt\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)\npd.set_option('display.max_rows', None)\npd.set_option('display.float_format', lambda x: '%.5f' % x)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-11-30T12:02:31.597374Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-11-30T12:02:31.597826Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-11-30T12:02:32.083650Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-11-30T12:02:31.597789Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-11-30T12:02:32.082238Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_ = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/online-retail-ii-data-set-from-ml-repository/Year 2009-2010.csv\", encoding='iso-8859-9')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-11-30T12:02:32.086110Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-11-30T12:02:32.086661Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-11-30T12:02:33.688656Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-11-30T12:02:32.086623Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-11-30T12:02:33.687129Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df = df_.copy()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-11-30T12:02:33.690868Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-11-30T12:02:33.691944Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-11-30T12:02:33.738852Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-11-30T12:02:33.691903Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-11-30T12:02:33.737444Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"border-radius:10px; border:#632626 solid; padding: 15px; background-color: #FDF6EC; font-size:100%; text-align:left\">\n\n<h3 align=\"left\"><font color='#11324D'>👀 Features: </font></h3>\n\n1. **InvoiceNo**: Invoice number, a unique number assigned to each transaction or invoice.

This allows you to separate transactions for each customer into distinct groups.\n\n2. `agg()`: After the grouping, you use the `agg()` function to perform custom calculations on each customer group. This function is used to process the grouped data.\n\n3. `{'InvoiceDate': lambda x: (today_date - x.max()).days, ...}`: This section defines how each calculation should be performed. Here, a dictionary is used. Each key represents the name of the calculation to be applied to the grouped data. For example, 'InvoiceDate' is a key, and its corresponding value is a lambda function.\n\n4. `lambda x: (today_date - x.max()).days`: This expression explains the operation assigned to the 'InvoiceDate' key. The `lambda` expression creates an anonymous function. 'x' represents the data in the 'InvoiceDate' column for each customer. This lambda function calculates the number of days elapsed since the customer's last transaction date. 'today_date' should represent the current date.\n\nAs a result, the code calculates the following metrics for each customer:\n- **InvoiceDate**: The number of days since the customer's last transaction date.\n- **Invoice**: The total count of unique transactions made by the customer.\n- **TotalPrice**: The total monetary value of the customer's transactions.\n\nIn the end, these metrics are calculated for each customer and returned as a grouped DataFrame. This structure provides valuable data that can be used to segment customers for RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) or to examine customer behavior.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"rfm.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-11-30T12:02:38.407112Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-11-30T12:02:38.407444Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-11-30T12:02:38.420112Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-11-30T12:02:38.407415Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-11-30T12:02:38.418615Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":26,"outputs":[{"execution_count":26,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"             InvoiceDate  Invoice  TotalPrice\nCustomer ID                                  \n12346.00000          166       11   372.86000\n12347.00000            4        2  1323.32000\n12348.00000           75        1   222.16000\n12349.00000           44        3  2671.14000\n12351.00000           12        1   300.93000","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>InvoiceDate</th>\n      <th>Invoice</th>\n      <th>TotalPrice</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Customer ID</th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>12346.00000</th>\n      <td>166</td>\n      <td>11</td>\n      <td>372.86000</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>12347.00000</th>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>1323.32000</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>12348.00000</th>\n      <td>75</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>222.16000</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>12349.00000</th>\n      <td>44</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>2671.14000</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>12351.00000</th>\n      <td>12</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>300.93000</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"rfm.columns = ['recency', 'frequency', 'monetary'] #

In this specific case, the highest recency values will be labeled as '5,' and as the recency values decrease, the labels will decrease from '5' to '1.'\n\nThe reason for doing this is to standardize and make the recency values more interpretable. For example, when one value is 165 and another is 2, it's challenging to establish a meaningful relationship between them. By applying this quantile-based ranking, you are essentially categorizing the recency values into five buckets based on their distribution. Additionally, for the \"recency\" metric, the labels are arranged in reverse order because in this context, smaller values are considered more valuable.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# 0-100, 0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80, 80-100 percentiles\n\nrfm[\"frequency_score\"] = pd.qcut(rfm['frequency'].rank(method=\"first\"), 5, labels=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-11-30T12:02:38.535499Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-11-30T12:02:38.536291Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-11-30T12:02:38.549992Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-11-30T12:02:38.536244Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-11-30T12:02:38.548568Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":33,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"border-radius:10px; border:#867070 solid; padding: 15px; background-color: #F5EBEB; font-size:100%; text-align:left\">\n\n<h3 align=\"left\"><font color='#5E5273'>📄 Notes: </font></h3>\n\n- `rfm['frequency']:` This part refers to a column (or metric) called \"frequency\" in a DataFrame named \"rfm.\" It represents how frequently customers have engaged in transactions.\n\n- `.rank(method='first'):` This segment performs the ranking process.

Champions have made recent purchases (low Recency), shop frequently (high Frequency), and typically make high-value transactions (high Monetary). For marketers, this segment can be a focal point for increasing sales and retaining loyal customers.\n2. **At Risk**: The At Risk segment includes customers who were previously active but have taken some time to make their most recent purchase. Their Recency is high, Frequency is moderate, and Monetary value is average. Re-engagement strategies can be applied to potentially retain these customers as they are at risk of being lost.\n3. **Hibernating**: Hibernating represents customers who have remained inactive for an extended period, and their most recent purchases were made a long time ago. They have a very high Recency, low Frequency, and low Monetary value. Re-engagement strategies should be implemented for these customers as they have the potential to become active again.\n4. **Loyal Customers**: This segment includes customers who shop frequently and tend to make high-value purchases. Recency is low, Frequency is high, and Monetary value is also high. These customers are loyal and valuable, making it important to maintain their satisfaction and loyalty.\n5. **Cant Lose**: This segment consists of rare but high-value customers. Their Recency is low, Frequency is low, but their Monetary value is very high. While they may make fewer purchases, these contribute significantly. Efforts should be made to prevent losing these customers.\n6. **Need Attention**: The Need Attention segment covers customers who were previously active but took some time to make their most recent purchases. Their Recency is moderate, Frequency is low, and Monetary value is at a moderate level. It's important to pay attention to and reactivate these customers.\n7. **New Customers**: New Customers represent newly acquired customers. Their Recency is low, Frequency is low, and Monetary value is also low. Efforts should focus on acquiring and converting them into repeat customers.\n8. **Potential Loyalists**: This segment includes customers who make infrequent purchases but have recently made a transaction. Recency is low, Frequency is moderate, and Monetary value is at a moderate level. These customers have the potential to become loyal.\n9. **Promising**: Promising segment represents customers who made recent purchases but shop infrequently. Recency is low, Frequency is low, and Monetary value is low. Encouragement and strategies to increase their shopping activity are important.\n10. **About to Sleep**: The About to Sleep segment comprises customers who made recent purchases but shop infrequently. Their Recency is low, Frequency is low, and Monetary value is low. Re-activating and encouraging them to shop more is essential as they are potentially at risk of being lost.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# RFM's segment names;\n\nseg_map = {\n    r'[1-2][1-2]': 'hibernating',\n    r'[1-2][3-4]': 'at_Risk',\n    r'[1-2]5': 'cant_loose',\n    r'3[1-2]': 'about_to_sleep',\n    r'33': 'need_attention',\n    r'[3-4][4-5]': 'loyal_customers',\n    r'41': 'promising',\n    r'51': 'new_customers',\n    r'[4-5][2-3]': 'potential_loyalists',\n    r'5[4-5]': 'champions'\n}","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-11-30T12:02:38.640405Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-11-30T12:02:38.641290Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-11-30T12:02:38.654510Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-11-30T12:02:38.641250Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-11-30T12:02:38.652602Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":38,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"rfm['segment'] = rfm['RFM_SCORE'].replace(seg_map, regex=True)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-11-30T12:02:38.658585Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-11-30T12:02:38.659651Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-11-30T12:02:38.801139Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-11-30T12:02:38.659601Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-11-30T12:02:38.798160Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":39,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"border-radius:10px; border:#867070 solid; padding: 15px; background-color: #F5EBEB; font-size:100%; text-align:left\">\n\n<h3 align=\"left\"><font color='#5E5273'>📄 Notes: </font></h3>\n\n1. Expressions like `r'[1-2][1-2]'`, `r'[1-2][3-4]'`, `r'[1-2]5`: These are regular expressions. Regular expressions are powerful tools used to define and find text matches. These expressions are designed to correspond to different combinations of RFM scores. For instance, `r'[1-2][1-2]'` represents customers with a \"Recency\" score of 1 or 2 and a \"Frequency\" score of 1 or 2.\n\n2. Values like `'hibernating'`, `'at_Risk'`, `'cant_loose'`: These values represent the segment names assigned to each combination of RFM scores. In other words, customers with a specific combination of RFM scores determine which segment they belong to based on these values.\n\n3. `rfm['segment'] = rfm['RFM_SCORE'].replace(seg_map, regex=True)`: In this line, it transforms RFM scores in the \"RFM_SCORE\" column into the segment names specified in the \"seg_map\" using regular expression-based mapping. The `regex=True` parameter ensures that this transformation occurs using regular expressions. This means that RFM score combinations matching regular expressions are identified, and these combinations are converted to the specified segment names.\n\nIn conclusion, this code snippet uses regular expressions and a segmentation map to categorize the results of RFM analysis into segments. Each combination of RFM scores is assigned to a specific customer segment, enabling customers to be grouped into different categories, which can be used for marketing or strategic decision-making.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"rfm.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-11-30T12:02:38.802552Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-11-30T12:02:38.802917Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-11-30T12:02:38.819544Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-11-30T12:02:38.802877Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-11-30T12:02:38.818501Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":40,"outputs":[{"execution_count":40,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"

average \"Recency\" value (8.12), a high \"Frequency\" value (12.55), and a significantly high \"Monetary\" value (6852.26) on average. Customers in this segment make frequent purchases and typically spend substantial amounts. This customer group consists of loyal and high-value customers. Marketing strategies can focus on retaining and increasing sales within this segment.\n\n2. **At Risk**: The At Risk segment includes customers with a relatively high average \"Recency\" value (153.16), a moderate \"Frequency\" value (3.07), and an average \"Monetary\" value (1188.88). Customers in this segment may have the potential for repeat purchases, but their last purchase might have occurred some time ago. Customer retention and reactivation strategies can be applied to this group.\n\n3. **Hibernating**: The Hibernating segment comprises customers with a very high average \"Recency\" value (214.88), low \"Frequency\" (1.13), and low \"Monetary\" value (403.98).

CLTV helps in predicting the value that customers will bring to a company in the future and guides businesses in developing customer-focused strategies and budget allocation for marketing efforts.\n\n**Why is it important?**\n\n- Predicting future customer behavior helps companies adjust their relationships and adopt more customer-centric, value-oriented approaches.\n- It plays a role in determining marketing budgets.\n- By calculating the value of existing customers (CLTV), it can be compared with the cost of acquiring new customers.\n\n**How to Calculate CLTV?**\n\nThe following formulas are used to calculate CLTV:\n\n1. **Customer Value:**\n\n   - Customer Value = Average Order Value x Purchase Frequency\n   \n   - Average Order Value = Total Price / Total Transaction\n   \n   - Purchase Frequency = Total Transaction / Total Number of Customers\n\n2. **Churn Rate:**\n\n   - Churn Rate = 1 - Repeat Rate\n\n   - Repeat Rate = (Number of customers making multiple purchases) / (Total customers)\n\n3. **Profit Margin:**\n\n   - Profit Margin = Total Price x 0.10 (Assumed Profit Margin)\n\n4. **CLTV Calculation:**\n\n   - CLTV = (Customer Value / Churn Rate) x Profit Margin","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"border-radius:10px; border:#632626 solid; padding: 15px; background-color: #FDF6EC; font-size:100%; text-align:left\">\n\n<h3 align=\"left\"><font color='#11324D'>👀 Parameters: </font></h3>\n\n1. **Customer Value:** A metric that represents the customer's lifelong contribution to the business. It is typically calculated by multiplying the average order value by the purchase frequency.\n2. **Churn Rate:** The rate at which customers leave the business within a specific period. It is usually expressed as a percentage.\n3. **Profit Margin:** Indicates the percentage of profit from the sale of a product or service. Profit Margin reflects the difference between total revenue and total costs.\n4. **Average Order Value:** It represents the average amount of money a customer spends during an average transaction. It is calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of transactions.\n5. **Purchase Frequency:** Calculated by dividing the total number of transactions in a specific period by the total number of customers. It indicates how often an average customer makes a purchase.\n6. **Total Price:** Represents the total revenue generated during a specific period.\n7. **Total Transaction:** The total number of transactions that occurred during a specific period.\n8. **Total Number of Customers:** The total number of customers who interacted with the business during a specific period.\n9. **Repeat Rate:** The percentage of customers who revisit the business or make repeat purchases during a specific period.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"border-radius:10px; border:#632626 solid; padding: 15px; background-color: #FDF6EC; font-size:100%; text-align:left\">\n\n<h3 align=\"left\"><font color='#11324D'>💡 Example: </font></h3>\n\nCertainly, here's the translated explanation of the CLTV calculation example:\n\n**Data:**\n- Total Number of Customers: 100\n- Churn Rate: 0.8 (The rate at which customers churn within a certain time period)\n- Profit Margin: 0.10 (Profit margin of 10%)\n\n**Sample Customer Data:**\n    \n- Generated 300 in the 1st transaction.\n- Generated 400 in the 2nd transaction.\n- Generated 500 in the 3rd transaction.\n- Total Number of Transactions: 3\n- Total Revenue (Total Price): 1200 (can also be referred to as units)\n\n**Calculations:**\n    \n1. Calculate the Average Order Value:\n    \n   - Average Order Value = Total Revenue / Total Number of Transactions\n    \n   - Average Order Value = 1200 / 3 = 400\n\n2. Calculate the Purchase Frequency:\n    \n   - Purchase Frequency = Total Number of Transactions / Total Number of Customers\n    \n   - Purchase Frequency = 3 / 100 = 0.03 (or 3%)\n\n3. Calculate the Profit Margin:\n    \n   - Profit Margin = Total Revenue x 0.10\n    \n   - Profit Margin = 1200 x 0.10 = 120\n\n4. Calculate the Customer Value:\n    \n   - Customer Value = Average Order Value x Purchase Frequency\n    \n   - Customer Value = 400 x 0.03 = 12\n\n5.

`groupby('Customer ID')`: The first step initiates grouping by customer IDs. In other words, it groups all transactions of each customer under a single customer ID.\n\n2. `agg(...)`: After the grouping by customer ID, different operations are performed for each group. This allows us to make calculations on a per-customer basis.\n\n3. `'Invoice': lambda x: x.nunique()`: First, it calculates the number of unique invoices for each customer. In other words, it finds out how many different invoices each customer has.\n\n4. `'Quantity': lambda x: x.sum()`: Next, it calculates the total quantity of products for each customer. This gives us the total amount of products purchased by the customer across all orders.\n\n5. `'TotalPrice': lambda x: x.sum()`: Finally, it calculates the total expenditure of each customer. This means how much the customer has spent in total across all orders.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"cltv_df.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-11-30T12:02:43.380857Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-11-30T12:02:43.381221Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-11-30T12:02:43.393170Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-11-30T12:02:43.381190Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-11-30T12:02:43.391646Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":58,"outputs":[{"execution_count":58,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"             Invoice  Quantity  TotalPrice\nCustomer ID                               \n12346.00000       11        70   372.86000\n12347.00000        2       828  1323.32000\n12348.00000        1       373   222.16000\n12349.00000        3       993  2671.14000\n12351.00000        1       261   300.93000","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Invoice</th>\n      <th>Quantity</th>\n      <th>TotalPrice</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Customer ID</th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>12346.00000</th>\n      <td>11</td>\n      <td>70</td>\n      <td>372.86000</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>12347.00000</th>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>828</td>\n      <td>1323.32000</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>12348.00000</th>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>373</td>\n      <td>222.16000</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>12349.00000</th>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>993</td>\n      <td>2671.14000</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>12351.00000</th>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>261</td>\n      <td>300.93000</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"cltv_df.columns = ['total_transaction', 'total_unit', 'total_price']","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-11-30T12:02:43.395349Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-11-30T12:02:43.395751Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-11-30T12:02:43.406056Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-11-30T12:02:43.395719Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-11-30T12:02:43.404321Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":59,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"cltv_df.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-11-30T12:02:43.409101Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-11-30T12:02:43.409652Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-11-30T12:02:43.426708Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-11-30T12:02:43.409602Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-11-30T12:02:43.425233Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":60,"outputs":[{"execution_count":60,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"             total_transaction  total_unit  total_price\nCustomer ID                                            \n12346.00000                 11          70    372.86000\n12347.00000                  2         828   1323.32000\n12348.00000                  1         373    222.16000\n12349.00000                  3         993   2671.14000\n12351.00000                  1         261    300.93000","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>total_transaction</th>\n      <th>total_unit</th>\n      <th>total_price</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Customer ID</th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>12346.00000</th>\n      <td>11</td>\n      <td>70</td>\n      <td>372.86000</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>12347.00000</th>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>828</td>\n      <td>1323.32000</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>12348.00000</th>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>373</td>\n      <td>222.16000</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>12349.00000</th>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>993</td>\n      <td>2671.14000</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>12351.00000</th>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>261</td>\n      <td>300.93000</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id = \"17\"></a><br>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Rockwell', cursive;

For example, in a dice rolling game, the outcome of which number the dice will land on is a random variable. It is a variable that can produce unpredictable results.\n2. **Poisson Distribution**: The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of rare events. For example, it can be used to estimate how often a traffic light will malfunction within a certain time frame. The Poisson distribution is suitable for cases where events are independent and occur at a constant average rate.\n3. **Gamma Distribution**: The gamma distribution is a continuous probability distribution and is especially used to model the number of random events occurring within a specific time period. It is commonly used to model the durations of events generated from a Poisson distribution.\n4. **p Probability**: \"p\" represents the probability of a specific outcome of an event. For example, the probability that a customer will churn after making a purchase can be expressed as \"p.\" This probability provides information about whether a customer will take a certain action or not.\n5. **Beta Distribution**: The beta distribution is used to model a parameter of a probability distribution. It is commonly used to model probabilities such as the churn rate of customers. The beta distribution is used to express the distribution of probabilities.\n\nThese terms are used in modeling customer behavior and predicting customer lifetime value. For instance, they can be used to model and predict factors like how often a customer will make a purchase or the probability of them churning.

than once. Repeat customers, those with a frequency greater than 1, are more likely to make future purchases and are generally more valuable to a business. Customers who make a one-time purchase (frequency equals 1) often have lower potential for long-term profitability. Therefore, considering only repeat customers helps businesses create more effective marketing strategies and increase customer loyalty.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"cltv_df[\"recency\"] = cltv_df[\"recency\"] // 7 # convert weekly period","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-11-30T12:03:06.837650Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-11-30T12:03:06.838198Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-11-30T12:03:06.847834Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-11-30T12:03:06.838115Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-11-30T12:03:06.846839Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":105,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"cltv_df[\"T\"] = cltv_df[\"T\"] // 7 # convert weekly period","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-11-30T12:03:06.849334Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-11-30T12:03:06.849706Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-11-30T12:03:06.859647Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-11-30T12:03:06.849675Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-11-30T12:03:06.858556Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":106,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"border-radius:10px; border:#867070 solid; padding: 15px; background-color: #F5EBEB; font-size:100%; text-align:left\">\n\n<h3 align=\"left\"><font color='#5E5273'>📄 Notes: </font></h3>\n    \nWhy are T and Recency values calculated on a weekly basis?\n\nT (tenure) and recency (the time since a customer's last purchase) values are often calculated on a weekly basis because it is a measure that allows for better analysis of transaction data and the prediction of customer behavior. Calculating them on a weekly basis helps capture seasonal fluctuations and other factors in transaction data more effectively.\n\nAdditionally, measuring in weekly units helps in better understanding and decision-making when it comes to transaction data because many transactions, especially in the retail sector, occur on a weekly cycle. Therefore, using weekly-based T and recency values for examining customer shopping behaviors enables businesses to improve customer relationship management and enhance marketing strategies more

higher frequencies with lower prices (Monetary: 691.71010).\n\nHow do these customers with such high Recency values promise the highest value?\n\nAccording to the BG/NBD theory, for a customer who is regular for you, as the Recency value increases (user-specific, within itself), the likelihood of the customer making a purchase approaches. There was partial churn after each transaction. In other words, after each transaction, the urge to purchase is satisfied, the need is met, and there is a drop. Until the need to purchase re-emerges.\n\nFor example, let's consider No:843. Its Frequency is low, its Age (T) is low, but it promises very high potential as it ranks in the top 5.\n\nIt provides us with valuable information up to those with low profitability.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id = \"35\"></a><br>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Rockwell', cursive; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 2px; color: #556B2F;

business. However, this value is not expressed in terms of money. Instead, it represents the revenue that a customer brings to the business.\n\nCLTV is used to determine the current or potential value of a customer. This value represents an estimated amount of the revenue a customer is expected to generate for the business. For example, a customer's CLTV value might be 500 units, indicating that the customer is expected to bring 500 units of revenue to the business.\n\nCLTV prediction aims to forecast the future customer value. These predictions include an estimate of the revenue a customer is expected to bring in the future, based on their future purchasing habits, loyalty, and expected revenue generation. CLTV predictions are also revenue estimates, expressed in a specific currency or monetary amount.\n\nIn summary, CLTV and CLTV predictions are metrics that measure the revenue generated for a business, but they are not directly expressed as a specific amount of money.\n    \n-------\n\n**CLTV**\n\n* CLTV calculation represents a single time period. It represents the time frame in which the analysis is conducted.\n* Total Price is the dominant factor and overshadows the impact of purchase frequency.\n* Once it has brought in the same revenue, the number of transactions is not significant.\n* Churn Rate is revenue from the entire customer base, not individual, which is a drawback.\n* Profit Margin is revenue from the entire customer base, not individual, which is a drawback.","metadata":{}}]}
